# Classification-Models-for-Kaggle-Competition
ML used to solve spaceship passenger disappearance due to spacetime anomaly. Filled missing data, created new features, encoded categorical columns, and trained 4 classifiers (KNN, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest). Gradient Boosting had highest accuracy (.8076). GitHub project showcasing ML in problem-solving.
